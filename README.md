Group repository for PICO-8 game which will be implemented during Spring 2022 semester.

So far the current state of the game has been based around code provided by the Nerdy Teachers' youtube tutorial on a Pico-8 Platformer. (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbMjF_cWciuBUZjILNL1fyA)

Our team logo was also based on a Lexaloffle thread discussing inventing your own logo/splash screen.

We also implemented a 'lightning game' as an assignment for our course which can be found in the fast game folder.
Some of our methods in this game where inspired from this Code with Carl youtube video.
